#  Electricity Consumption Forecasting

##  Project Overview

This project is designed to forecast electricity consumption using historical data and machine learning techniques. It consists of a console-based ML pipeline for model training and a Streamlit web app for real-time prediction. The goal is to help users predict electricity usage for a specific date and time, enabling better energy management and planning.
